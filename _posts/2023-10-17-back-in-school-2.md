am committing to put stuff on this blog (again) not like i've written a regular blog before okay

So I found the time to open my blog folder, and apparently I already tried to reboot this blog once... last year. So much for that.  
In the meantime, I've, uh,

* gone through 2 terms of university
* put an amogus on the SUTD logo and printed it
* built two cubes out of aluminium extrusions
    * one of which I put 2 STM32 boards and 25 servos into
    * one of which I'm about to put a Voron Trident into
* gone on a summer programme in Korea, during which I made a calibration cat out of clay
* learned how to fly FPV
* built two keyboards from scratch - PCB, case and all
* installed Fedora, forgot about it, then started using it again - I think for the third time now?
* changed my pillar (and most likely career) plans

So, er, not much!

I will (hopefully, if I have time), start actually posting to this blog, with topics including

* my upcoming Tridex build
* FPV/drone stuff
* QMK shenanigans
* random interesting stuff!

Putting up some posts to get started, check them out.
