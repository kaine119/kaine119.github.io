# Hello!

I'm Kai En, an aspiring software developer. I live in Singapore, and 
I'm planning to study computer science at SUTD.

Right now there's nothing much on this website, as I'm busy with national service. 
In time, I'm adding a portfolio of my previous [projects](/projects).

## Some things I can do

* Python, Ruby, JavaScript, C#, Java
* Web development
	- Frontend: HTML/CSS/JS, Vue.JS, AngularJS 1.x, Bulma.css, Bootstrap
	- Backend: Flask, Sinatra, ExpressJS
	- Static site generators: Jekyll (you're looking at one right now!)
	- Cloud deployment: Heroku (and maybe AWS, MS Azure)
* Native stuff
  - recently been working on some .NET WPF projects
  - previously worked on a few Android applications
* Currently (planning to) work on
  - 3D product modelling, PCB CAD work
  - Microcontroller development with C
