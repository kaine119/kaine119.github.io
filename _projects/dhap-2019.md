While taking photos at an open house, a friend of mine from ISAC asked if I wanted to help them make a website for their Model ASEAN Summit event, DHAP, for that year. I was like, sure, why not? What followed was about three months of close interaction with a group of people who I would've never otherwise even spoken to. We worked together to refine and implement the design vision they had for their site. Overall, it was a fun experience, and I'd definitely do it again.

On the technical side of things, it's nothign too impressive. Jekyll's templating features really helped with the rapid development of a changing design by keeping everything consistent across the website, all without too much overhead at dev-time or runtime. I nixed any JS frameworks, as they'd be overkill for a static website like this.
