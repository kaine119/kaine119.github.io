When I started my internship at GovTech's Sensors & IoT office, I was initially tasked with exploring localisation hardware for potential future development. A couple of days in, though, I noticed my supervisor (and a chunk of the rest of the office) were more busy with an upcoming demo deadline. I asked if they needed any help with that instead, and so I started work on an asset tracking feature in a mobile application.

I'm going to stay on the safe side of the NDA, but I can say that interning at GovTech was definitely a fun experience! My coworkers were all very friendly, and I learned a lot not just from my project, but from chatting with people working on other projects too. This internship happened right around when the COVID-19 pandemic was beginning to end, so I met a few people working on pandemic-related projects like TraceTogether, and the insight into their hardware development process was one of the things that led me to pursuing electronics and hardware development.
