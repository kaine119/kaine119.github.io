Just before I started NS, I did a 1-month long internship at DSTA, where I explored the capabilities of a wireless network pentesting tool, the WiFi Pineapple. I don't remember what exactly I did, but I remember it wasn't anything special at the end lmaoo

Nevertheless, it was a fun experience and an interesting dive into wireless networking.
