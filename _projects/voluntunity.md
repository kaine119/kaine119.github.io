This was a competition submission for i.code 2016, with me and two friends from ICC later submitting this for SiTF later that year. We didn't really know what we were doing, and mostly got distracted by studies, so in the end we cobbled this together in about one or two months? i think. We somehow got all the way to SiTF finals, but unfortunately we didn't get anything else other than that.

It was an Android app featuring a map of local volunteering opportunities (hence the name "Volun-tunity", we weren't being very creative here). We also had a separate web portal where organizations were supposed to be able to submit openings, which would go into a Firebase database (we didn't have the time or knowhow to build a database server at the time, so a simple document drop made more sense). There was also Facebook integration, apparently, although I've long forgotten what that was supposed to be for.

In the end, it was mostly a disappointment, but at least the time spent working with my friends was fun :p
